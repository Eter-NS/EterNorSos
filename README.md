# About Me

Hello! I'm Norbert, a graduate of the "Skills of Tomorrow" course organised by Google and SGH (SzkoÅ‚a GÅ‚Ã³wna Handlowa in Warsaw), where I focused on UX and SEO optimisation, also including Internet marketing.

Currently, self-motivated front-end developer ðŸŽ¨ who wants to create applications to make this world a better place or at least save time to spend it with the closest ones ðŸ’•

I've learned HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular (RxJS and Signals) to make it possible, but it does not stop here. The journey only just started ðŸš€

## My Portfolio

I'm aware my GitHub is not the cleanest in the world, and that's why I want to show you my pearls:

- [Random Color Generator](https://eter-ns.github.io/Random-Color-Creator/) - A simple webpage which generates random colours based on the user's instructions and the history of generated ones,
- [Random Color Generator API](https://github.com/Eter-NS/Random-color-generator-API) - API based on the project above to generate random colours. Published on NPM,
- [Memo-licious](https://github.com/Eter-NS/Memo-licious_Angular-app) - A PWA inspired by the Google Material chips list layout to create to-do/shopping lists. Written using Angular framework and Firebase (Angular Fire). 

## Side Improvement (Workflow & more)

To speed up my workflow, I'm using ChatGPT and Google Bard to provide ideas and discussions on what parts I can improve my apps.

I am looking for recommendations for books or topics that can help me improve my skills as a colleague. Because we all have the same goal, right?
Wanna discuss something - I'm open on my [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/eter_ns) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/norbert-sosnowski-629535197/)
